# feedback-portal-piper

The website appears to be a feedback portal for an organization named Pied Piper Inc. It features a clean and modern UI with a navigation bar on the left side that includes links to Home, Feedback, Objectives, Team, and Recognition. The main panel on the right displays the Feedback section, with tabs for 'To me', 'Given by me', and 'Requests'. Below this, there is a button labeled 'Ask for feedback' aligned to the right. The 'Suggested for you' section lists employees with their names, departments, and profile pictures, followed by an 'Ask for feedback' button for each. The color scheme is composed of whites and light greys, with blue accents for buttons and links. Fonts are sans-serif, giving a modern and accessible look. At the bottom, there is a 'New post' button centered.
